# omnidata-sample-data

A small sample dataset from the Omnidata Starter Dataset in the following paper:

**A Scalable Pipeline for Making Multi-Task Mid-Level Vision Datasets from 3D Scans**

This is only one sample scene in our **GSO + Replica** dataset split, which is created by scattering [Google Scanned Objects](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/collections/Google%20Scanned%20Objects) around [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset) buildings using the [Habitat](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) environment. The full **Omnidata Starter Dataset** contains more than `14 million images` from over `2000 spaces`. 

For more details and the full dataset please see the [main dataset repository](https://github.com/EPFL-VILAB/omnidata-dataset) and the [project website](https://omnidata.vision).
